## Project To-Do - Personal Project
Live Website: https://project-management-todo.herokuapp.com/

### Inspiration
As I handle a few personal projects, I tend to have several thoughts in mind on what can be future improvement or bugs that I might need to solve. Hence, I enhanced a normal todo application with folder capability, to able to categories my todo into projects. While Trello is available for such purpose, I decided to attempt to develop one using MaterialUI as a practice.


### Features
1. Add Task Folders
2. Add Task specifically to folder
3. Delete Task
4. Delete Task Folder

### Future Update
Currently working on APIs to GET/POST/DELETE using NodeJS, ExpressJS and with MongoDB as database. Do look forward to the update in the future. Furthermore, there will be personal account functionality for the public to use.
